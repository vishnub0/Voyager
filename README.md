# MESSAGE TO STANFORD AIMI SUMMER RESEARCH INTERNSHIP
Hello! I think I forgot to upload my certificates for the Logic and Problem Solving course and the Philosophy of AI course. I have uploaded them here so that you can verify my participation. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience!

This is my game for my school Game Project. It is called Voyager and is heavily influenced by the Star Trek Original Series.

I used Java Swing for the graphics and JoeTTS in order to mimic Mr. Kim's voice.
